As a part of my CPE 4903 machine learning and neural networks class, i chose to do a captsone machine vision project which i have documented and posted in this repository.
Cat-Dog Classifier - uses CNN for binary classification between cat and dog using powered by a raspberry pi and rasberry pi-camera.
MNIST handwriting classifier - model trained using MNIST database to detect handwritten digits between 1-10 using rasberry pi-camera

all the specs have been detailed in the project report.
